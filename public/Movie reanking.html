<h1>The Best Movies I've watched so far</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Watched 100's of movies. These ones still marvel me till today.</h2>

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War 2018</h3>  
<p>
I've always been a sucker for super hero movies and I didn't find it surprising when they released these series of movies.
It was just fun to watch and easy to catch up with the fantasy of the superheroes. I had watched DC superheroes while growing up
and really enjoyed them. The justice league especially. After watching a few movies in the Marvel universe, I went back in time 
to catch up with the starting movies of the marvel universe. For example, Ironman 2008. Spiderman wasn't really thought to be 
a part of the Marvel universe initially. Or at least, I thought that. I just figured it out later on. We can also say that Marvel 
started their own league a little bit late. Maybe it just wasn't televised as much as the Justice league was because I didn't know
anything called Avengers until it became really popular.

<P>
That said, I gotta say the Marvel company, or whoever owns the franchise, did a great job with the actual movie they produced for people
to watch. It had really great cinematics, visuals, video, VFX, good photoshops :) but more importantly, it had a great story line. 
It's definitely one of those movies whereby you fall in love with the villain even though he's evil. I guess. Thanos wasn't necessarily
evil after all. He just gradually carried out harsh truths with gentle violence. H was doing the right thing from his own point of view 
and we may not understand fully well since we don't know what he knows. It's all a beautiful story regardless. What else do I have to tell 
you about the movie? 
If you haven't watched it, go back in time and watch it now. It'll change the way you see the world.

<h3>Ready Player One 2018</h3>
<p>This was a dystopian movie I really liked because of how smart it was. Or perhaps, how the main character outsmarted the antagonist in the
movie. His actions triggered me to stop thinking in the conventional manner where he decided to thinking backwards rather than forwards as
we all do as humans. In fact, I think I'm gonna watch it again. Obviously, the vision portrayed in the movie, the way the graphics and
whatnot were played out was also awesome and that's equally cool. I guess we're gradually gravitating towards that lifestyle of using VR 
headsets more often than not now since Apple introduced theirs. All the same, You should watch it if you haven't.
</p>
<h3>Knives Out 2019</h3>
<p>Well, I can't really say much about the sequel of this movie. Was it worth the time? No. But this prequel, my friend, was worth the time. I watched 
this with zero expectations in mind but i was wowed with the twist & turns of the movie. The murder of a certain grouchy old father/grandpa 
became the point of investigation in the movie with some confusion added to the mix. I'm sure anyone who watched the movie faced the same 
kind of "headache" but all in all. It was beautifully curated set of scenes and acts. Kudos to the creators!
</p>
<h3>La Casa de Papel 2017</h3>
<p>If you're reading this and you haven't watch this series then there's no difference between you and the one who hasn't watched Game of
Thrones. If you didn't watch GOT, Money Heist, and Squid Game then I don't know what you spend your Netflix and Chill time doing. I don't
think I have much to say because this one speaks for itself. Have you seen Money Heist Korea? I doubt. For a movie to have a remake from 
another country then you know what's up. Just check it out if you haven't. You can come to my house to flog me if you didn't enjoy it. 
</p>
<h3>YOU 2018</h3>
<p>YOU is a psychological thriller series I can bet you won't enjoy if you won't like sex scenes and gory scenes. Don't get me wrong, the sex scenes 
aren't hardcore but the gory ones sure are. LOL. Hey, go watch it. You'll enjoy it if you read a lot of books and enjoy living life a slow
non-comments-likes-reposts-filled life. The guy's a cool guy when you first sight him.
</p>
<h3>Inception 2010</h3> 
<p>I've only watched this very recently with the help of useful sci-fi recommendations on my Telegram. Leonardo Di Caprio was featured as the
main character in this movie and it's definitely a magnificent movie as you're thinking right now. The movie made understand how dreams are
formed in our minds while we sleep and how powerful the subconscious mind is. It was about idea implantation via the use of a dream-sharing 
technology which they used to carry out that "nefarious" acts. I guess they were dream mercenaries. You should check this out if you're 
naturally inquisitive like me
